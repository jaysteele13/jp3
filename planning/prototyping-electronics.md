## Here is the place I try out the gear.

### ESP32

`**30/11/2025 - Blink Works**`
I made an environent to compile and upload code. I get the second LED to blink to show that the ESP32 compiled the code correctly. The on memory is low. We will see how much of a challenge this will pose in the future to utilise all components.

    plan for next time:
    - Power esp32 via power rails
    - Create environment and branches for OLED connectivity
    - Create small GUI system. Plan ahead for button usage. Song Names, Albums, animations, as well as battery life
